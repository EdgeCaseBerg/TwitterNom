TwitterNom
=======================================================================

A simple python script to eat data and store it into mongo

The W's
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Mongo? 

Yes, mongo because I don't care about the relationships between tweets,
only the actual data itself.

- Python?

Python is pretty normal to find in data analysis and the natural
language toolkits provide a good deal of interesting ways to look
through data. 

Setup
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- install mongodb
- pymongo
- tweepy


Then setup the conf.json file and run `python nom.py`
